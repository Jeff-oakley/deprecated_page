      <p>Using both computations and experiments, we demonstrate that the performance of Li-excess cation-disordered rocksalt cathodes can be improved by Mg substitution. Mg reduces the amount of Li in the compound that is strongly bound to F and thereby increases the capacity. This enables the use of fluorination as a tool to improve stability of the compounds without significant loss of capacity. Mg emerged as the most optimal substitution element from a systematic computational study aimed at identifying inactive doping elements with a strong enough bonding strength to fluorine to displace Li from the F environments. Our results also show that capacity can be traded for cycle life depending on whether Mg is substituted for Li or for the redox metal. This design strategy should be considered in fluorinated cathodes, which will facilitate the design of optimized disordered rocksalt oxyfluoride cathodes.</p>

      <p>The discovery of promising inorganic superionic conductors for use as solid-state electrolytes can enable the design of safe and high-energy-density solid-state batteries. Li argyrodites with the composition Li–P–S–X (X = Cl, Br, or I) have been found to have an ionic conductivity of up to 14.8 mS/cm, indicating the ability of the argyrodite framework to conduct alkali-metal ions. However, the sodium version of argyrodites remains unexplored. In this work, using first-principles density functional theory calculations, we examine the phase stability, electrochemical stability, and ionic conductivity of 48 potential Na argyrodites with different pnictogen, chalcogen, and halogen chemistries and site occupancies. We find that for sulfide-based Na argyrodites, the compounds with halogens occupying both the 4a and 4c sites typically display better ionic conductivity. However, the larger size of the Se2– anion makes selenide-based Na argyrodites less-dependent on the exact halogen-site occupancy. Most of the Na argyrodites have positive zero-K formation energy but are within the typical energy where compounds, including the Li argyrodite, can be synthesized. We find that compounds within the Na–P–Se–X (X = Cl, Br, or I) chemical space may form a good compromise between ionic conductivity, phase stability, and synthesizability.</p>

      <p>This work investigates the electrochemical Na+/K+ ion exchange mechanism occurring in layered Na3Ni2SbO6. Structural characterizations using X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy uncover a remarkable and rich phase evolution as K is inserted in partially desodiated NaxNi2SbO6. Rather than simple addition of K to the structure, we see significant Na rearrangement, with discrete Na phases traversing the full range of Na compositions, even though the overall Na content in the sample is not changed. At any given time as much as three distinct phases can be present in the sample, consistent with thermodynamic equilibrium rules. Using DFT computations we demonstrate that this remarkable phase behavior during ion exchange is due to the repulsion between Na+ and K+ which creates distinct phases of them. Our analysis should be applicable to other ion-exchange systems where the exchanged ions are not well miscible in the host structure.</p>

      <p>In the synthesis of inorganic materials, reactions often yield non-equilibrium kinetic byproducts instead of the thermodynamic equilibrium phase. Understanding the competition between thermodynamics and kinetics is a fundamental step towards the rational synthesis of target materials. Here, we use in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction to investigate the multistage crystallization pathways of the important two-layer (P2) sodium oxides Na0.67MO2 (M = Co, Mn). We observe a series of fast non-equilibrium phase transformations through metastable three-layer O3, O3′ and P3 phases before formation of the equilibrium two-layer P2 polymorph. We present a theoretical framework to rationalize the observed phase progression, demonstrating that even though P2 is the equilibrium phase, compositionally unconstrained reactions between powder precursors favour the formation of non-equilibrium three-layered intermediates. These insights can guide the choice of precursors and parameters employed in the solid-state synthesis of ceramic materials, and constitutes a step forward in unravelling the complex interplay between thermodynamics and kinetics during materials synthesis.</p>

      <p>High-entropy (HE) ceramics, by analogy with HE metallic alloys, are an emerging class of solid solutions composed of a large number of species. These materials offer the benefit of large compositional flexibility and can be used in a wide variety of applications, including thermoelectrics, catalysts, superionic conductors and battery electrodes. We show here that the HE concept can lead to very substantial improvements in performance in battery cathodes. Among lithium-ion cathodes, cation-disordered rocksalt (DRX)-type materials are an ideal platform within which to design HE materials because of their demonstrated chemical flexibility. By comparing a group of DRX cathodes containing two, four or six transition metal (TM) species, we show that short-range order systematically decreases, whereas energy density and rate capability systematically increase, as more TM cation species are mixed together, despite the total metal content remaining fixed. A DRX cathode with six TM species achieves 307 mAh g−1 (955 Wh kg−1) at a low rate (20 mA g−1), and retains more than 170 mAh g−1 when cycling at a high rate of 2,000 mA g−1. To facilitate further design in this HE DRX space, we also present a compatibility analysis of 23 different TM ions, and successfully synthesize a phase-pure HE DRX compound containing 12 TM species as a proof of concept.</p>

      <p>The tremendous improvement in performance and cost of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have made them the technology of choice for electrical energy storage. While established battery chemistries and cell architectures for Li-ion batteries achieve good power and energy density, LIBs are unlikely to meet all the performance, cost, and scaling targets required for energy storage, in particular, in large-scale applications such as electrified transportation and grids. The demand to further reduce cost and/or increase energy density, as well as the growing concern related to natural resource needs for Li-ion have accelerated the investigation of so-called “beyond Li-ion” technologies. In this review, we will discuss the recent achievements, challenges, and opportunities of four important “beyond Li-ion” technologies: Na-ion batteries, K-ion batteries, all-solid-state batteries, and multivalent batteries. The fundamental science behind the challenges, and potential solutions toward the goals of a low-cost and/or high-energy-density future, are discussed in detail for each technology. While it is unlikely that any given new technology will fully replace Li-ion in the near future, “beyond Li-ion” technologies should be thought of as opportunities for energy storage to grow into mid/large-scale applications.</p>

      <p>In this work, instrumented nanoindentation was employed to investigate the effect of interstitial oxygen or nitrogen addition on the incipient plasticity and dislocation nucleation in a body-centered cubic NbTiZrHf high-entropy alloy (HEA) at loading rates of 10–1000 µN/s. We conducted quantitative statistical analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to identify the role of interstitial oxygen/nitrogen during the onset of plasticity. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy were also performed to confirm that the oxygen/nitrogen atoms were indeed present as interstitial solutes. These interstitial solutes could increase the critical shear stress required to initiate plasticity, and nitrogen yielded a larger hardening effect than oxygen. The activation volumes were evaluated to be about 2–3 atomic volumes, indicating cooperative migration of multiple atoms during the dislocation nucleation, and neither oxygen nor nitrogen appeared to significantly affect this activation process. Hardness tests were also carried out and the result demonstrated that the enhancement of the critical shear stress for incipient plasticity was not caused by the traditional solid-solution strengthening mechanism. DFT calculations revealed that oxygen/nitrogen interstitials induced local charge transfer and improved the lattice cohesion, which was probably responsible for the enhanced pop-in load/stress in the current interstitially alloyed HEAs.</p>

      <p>Fluorine substitution is a critical enabler for improving the cycle life and energy density of disordered rocksalt (DRX) Li‐ion battery cathode materials which offer prospects for high energy density cathodes, without the reliance on limited mineral resources. Due to the strong Li–F interaction, fluorine also is expected to modify the short‐range cation order in these materials which is critical for Li‐ion transport. In this work, density functional theory and Monte Carlo simulations are combined to investigate the impact of Li–F short‐range ordering on the formation of Li percolation and diffusion in DRX materials. The modeling reveals that F substitution is always beneficial at sufficiently high concentrations and can, surprisingly, even facilitate percolation in compounds without Li excess, giving them the ability to incorporate more transition metal redox capacity and thereby higher energy density. It is found that for F levels below 15%, its effect can be beneficial or disadvantageous depending on the intrinsic short‐range order in the unfluorinated oxide, while for high fluorination levels the effects are always beneficial. Using extensive simulations, a map is also presented showing the trade‐off between transition‐metal capacity, Li‐transport, and synthetic accessibility, and two of the more extreme predictions are experimentally confirmed.</p>

      <p>The recent discovery of Li‐excess cation‐disordered rock salt cathodes has greatly enlarged the design space of Li‐ion cathode materials. Evidence of facile lattice fluorine substitution for oxygen has further provided an important strategy to enhance the cycling performance of this class of materials. Here, a group of Mn3+–Nb5+‐based cation‐disordered oxyfluorides, Li1.2Mn3+0.6+0.5x Nb5+0.2−0.5x O2−x Fx (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2) is investigated and it is found that fluorination improves capacity retention in a very significant way. Combining spectroscopic methods and ab initio calculations, it is demonstrated that the increased transition‐metal redox (Mn3+/Mn4+) capacity that can be accommodated upon fluorination reduces reliance on oxygen redox and leads to less oxygen loss, as evidenced by differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy measurements. Furthermore, it is found that fluorine substitution also decreases the Mn3+‐induced Jahn–Teller distortion, leading to an orbital rearrangement that further increases the contribution of Mn‐redox capacity to the overall capacity.</p>

      <p>Understanding the details of thermal transport in graphdiyne and its nanostructures would help to broaden their applications. On the basis of the molecular dynamics simulations and spectrally decomposed heat current analysis, we show that the high-frequency phonons in graphdiyne can be strongly hindered in nanoribbons because of the boundary scattering. The isotropic transport in graphdiyne can be switched to anisotropic along the armchair and zigzag directions. Adding side chains onto the nanoribbon edges further reduces the thermal conductivity (TC) along both armchair and zigzag directions thanks to the reduction of heat current carried by low-frequency modes, a mechanism that arises from the phonon resonances. The uniaxial tensile strain plays a different role in the TC of graphdiyne, armchair nanoribbons, and zigzag nanoribbons. Tensile strain causes the thermal conductivities of graphdiyne, and armchair nanoribbons increase first and then get reduced, whereas for zigzag nanoribbons, the TC decreases with strain first and reaches to a plateau. The different low-frequency phonon response on strain is the main reason for the different TC behavior. For graphdiyne and armchair nanoribbons, the low-frequency heat current is enhanced gradually first and then get reduced with the increase of strain, while that of zigzag nanoribbons decreases with strain and then increases slightly. The current studies could help us understand the phonon transport in graphdiyne and its nanoribbons, which is useful for their TC engineering.</p>

      <p>Several mixed ionic/electronic conductors (MIECs) used as fuel or electrolysis cell electrodes may be thought of as solid solutions of perovskite oxides and ordered oxygen vacancy compounds. For example, the model MIEC SrTi1–xFexO3–x/2+δ (STF) can be described as a mixture of the perovskite SrTiO3 and the brownmillerite Sr2Fe2O5 that can accommodate some degree of oxygen off-stoichiometry δ. The large configurational space for these nondilute, disordered mixtures has hindered atomic scale modeling, limiting in-depth understanding and predictive analysis. We present a cluster expansion framework to describe the energetics of the disordered STF system within the full solid solution composition space Sr(Ti1–xFex)O3–x/2, 0 &lt; x &lt; 1, δ = 0. Cluster expansion Monte Carlo (CEMC) simulations are performed to identify low-energy configurations and to investigate the origin and degree of lattice disorder. Using realistic configurations obtained from CEMC, the electronic structure, band gap, and optical properties of STF and their sensitivity to the stoichiometry are examined and compared to those of hypothetical ordered structures and special quasirandom structures. The predicted evolution of the band gap and optical absorption with composition is consistent with the experiment. Analysis of the electronic structure elucidates that electronic transport within the mixture benefits from the simultaneous presence of Fe/Ti disorder on the B cation sublattice and a tendency for oxygen vacancies to cluster around Fe atoms. The modeling framework adopted here for the SrTiO3/Sr2Fe2O5 mixture can be extended to other MIEC materials.</p>

      <p>Mn-based Li-excess cation-disordered rocksalt (DRX) oxyfluorides are promising candidates for next-generation rechargeable battery cathodes owing to their large energy densities, the earth abundance, and low cost of Mn. In this work, we synthesized and electrochemically tested four representative compositions in the Li-Mn-O-F DRX chemical space with various Li and F content. While all compositions achieve higher than 200 mAh g−1 initial capacity and good cyclability, we show that the Li-site distribution plays a more important role than the metal-redox capacity in determining the initial capacity, whereas the metal-redox capacity is more closely related to the cyclability of the materials. We apply these insights and generate a capacity map of the Li-Mn-O-F chemical space, LixMn2-xO2-yFy (1.167 ≤ x ≤ 1.333, 0 ≤ y ≤ 0.667), which predicts both accessible Li capacity and Mn-redox capacity. This map allows the design of compounds that balance high capacity with good cyclability.</p>

      <p>Li2FeSiO4 (LFS) is a sustainable Li-ion cathode material composed of earth-abundant elements with potentially high energy density but suffers from limited reversible storage capacity (less than one Li), low intrinsic conductivities, and cycling instability. In search of deeper understanding of the structural chemistry of LFS towards overcoming some of these challenges, the viability of Fe-site doping by Co and other dopants in Pmn21 LFS is investigated using both first-principles calculations and experimental testing. Computational results suggest that the formation of Li2Fe1−xCoxSiO4 is energetically favorable, predictions confirmed by successful hydrothermal synthesis. Substitution of Co in LFS is revealed to have a dual effect; firstly catalyzing faster electrochemically induced phase transformation to the stable inverse-Pmn21 phase; and secondly enabling the formation of a low-resistant, uniform and stable fluorine-rich cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI) layer that inhibits detrimental reactions between the cathode and electrolyte. As a result, Co-substituted LFS displays enhanced reversibility with 95% capacity retention after 50 cycles as compared to 80% of the undoped LFS.</p>

      <p>Defect engineering via nonstoichiometric composition control can serve as an effective strategy to tune the electronic and crystal structures of intercalation compounds, as has been recently evidenced in Li-rich cathode materials. To extend this strategy in another direction, Fe-richness as opposed to Li-richness is investigated in improving the electrochemical performance of a promising cathode material, Li2FeSiO4 (LFS). Nonstoichiometric LFS compounds in orthorhombic Pmn21 phase with up to 8% Fe-excess are successfully synthesized via controlled hydrothermal synthesis. It is demonstrated that, in addition to the higher electron capacity from the accessible Fe2+/Fe3+ redox couple, the presence of excess Fe enhances the intercalation kinetics vis-à-vis the stoichiometric composition. From combined electrochemical evaluation and first-principles DFT calculations, the enhanced kinetics are rationalized by the introduction of the FeLi• + VLi′ defect pair and newly generated electron conducting states from the creation of local Fe–O–Fe configurations. Moreover, the Fe-rich structure facilitates Fe migration to the Li-site due to a lower energy barrier than that of stoichiometric LFS, hence apparently leading to faster phase transformation from Pmn21 toward the cycled inverse Pmn21 phase. More generally, this study opens alternative defect and compositional engineering approaches in designing next generation intercalation materials with improved electrochemical performance.</p>

      <p>We proved that the critical thickness for metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) of LaNiO3 could be controlled by substrate orientation. By means
of density functional theory calculations, films grown on SrTiO3 substrates with (001), (110) and (111) orientations have different amount of
charge transfer across the interface. Different charge transfer induces different interfacial conductivity behavior and at the same time modifies
the carrier density of adjacent LaNiO3 films. The manipulation of MIT by substrate orientation can be achieved through interfacial charge
transfer induced interfacial conductive layer with the modified conductivity of LNO layer.</p>

      <p>Generalized-stacking-fault energy (GSFE) serves as an important metric that prescribes dislocation behaviors in materials. In this paper, utilizing first-principle calculations and chemical bonding analysis, we studied the behaviors of generalized stacking fault in graphene and h-BN. It has been shown that the π bond formation plays a critical role in the existence of metastable stacking fault (MSF) in graphene and h-BN lattice along certain slip directions. Chemical functionalization was then proposed as an effective means to engineer the π bond, and subsequently MSF along dislocation slips within graphene and h-BN. Taking hydrogenation as a representative functionalization method, we demonstrated that, with the preferential adsorption of hydrogen along the slip line, π electrons along the slip would be saturated by adsorbed hydrogen atoms, leading to the moderation or elimination of MSF. Our study elucidates the atomic mechanism of MSF formation in graphene-like materials, and more generally, provides important insights towards predictive tuning of mechanic properties in two-dimensional nanomaterials.</p>

      <p>A controllable phase transition between the semiconducting 2H phase and metallic/semimetallic T (1T, 1T′, and 1T″) isomorphs provides an effective route to tune and even switch physical and electronic properties within 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). In this study, the feasibility of curvature engineering in manipulating the structural phase is investigated employing first‐principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations and continuum mechanics analysis. With WSe2 and MoTe2 as TMD representatives, it is found that bending deformation can not only energetically induce 2H → T (1T, 1T′, or 1T″) phase transformation, but also kinetically facilitate the phase transition by lowering transition activation barriers. Moreover, a phase stability diagram is constructed which suggests ways of achieving both uniformly 2H → T phase transition and programming printing of T phases in 2H‐TMD membranes. The theoretical results not only suggest a new feasible experimental design strategy of phase engineering, but also sheds light on novel device design with the patterning of T phases on the 2H‐TMD membrane.</p>

      <p>Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides/metal (MX2/metal) based transistors have been widely studied. However, further development is hindered by the large contact resistance between MX2 and metal contact. In this paper, we demonstrated that interfacial charge transfer between MX2 and metal is the key for tuning contact resistance. With the lattice misfit criterion applied to screen combination of MX2s and metals, it has been found out that both phase stability of MX2 and contact nature between MX2 and metal will be sensitively affected by interfacial charge transfer. Additionally, we have identified seven MX2/metal systems that can potentially form zero Schottky barrier contacts utilizing phase engineering. On base of interfacial charge calculations and contact resistance analysis, we have presented three types of MX2/metal contacts that can be formed with distinguished contact resistance. Our theoretical results not only demonstrate various choice of MX2/metal designs in order to achieve different amounts of interfacial charge transfer as well as manipulate contact resistance, but also shed light on designing ohmic contacts in MX2/metal systems.</p>

      <p>A multi-functional photocatalyst, that can combine the catalytic functions of water oxidation and proton reduction together with light harvesting capacity, is highly desired for low cost, high efficiency, and highly stable solar fuel production. Monolayer WSe2, with a direct energy gap of   1.65 eV is a nearly ideal light absorber to convert sunlight to hydrogen fuels through solar water splitting. To date, however, the controlled synthesis of monolayer WSe2 on a wafer scale and the realization of overall water splitting on WSe2 have remained elusive. Here, we report the van de Waals epitaxy of crystalline monolayer WSe2 on large area amorphous SiOx substrates. We have demonstrated, for the first time, the multi-functionality of monolayer WSe2 in solar water splitting, including extraordinary capacities for efficient light harvesting, water oxidation, and proton reduction. The absorbed photon conversion efficiency exceeds 12% for a single monolayer WSe2. This work provides a viable strategy for wafer-scale synthesis of multi-functional photocatalysts for the development of efficient, low cost, and scalable solar fuel devices and systems.</p>

      <p>The potential application of monolayer MS2 (M = Mo, W) as thermoelectric material has been widely studied since the first report of successful fabrication. However, their performances are hindered by the considerable band gap and the large lattice thermal conductivity in the pristine 2H phase. Recent discoveries of polymorphism in MS2s provide new opportunities for materials engineering. In this work, phonon and electron transport properties of both 2H and 1T′ phases were investigated by first-principle calculations. It is found that upon the phase transition from 2H to 1T′ in MS2, the electron transport is greatly enhanced, while the lattice thermal conductivity is reduced by several times. These features lead to a significant enhancement of power factor by one order of magnitude in MoS2 and by three times in WS2. Meanwhile, the figure of merit can reach up to 0.33 for 1T′MoS2 and 0.68 for 1T′WS2 at low temperature. These findings indicate that monolayer MS2 in the 1T′ phase can be promising materials for thermoelectric devices application. Meanwhile, this work demonstrates that phase engineering techniques can bring in one important control parameter in materials design.</p>

      <p>The Mo-S system is crucial to extractive metallurgy, tribology, and various possible applications in design and fabrication of novel two-dimensional (2D) materials. First-principles calculations were utilized to compute the enthalpies of formation of molybdenum sulfides at 0 K and the heat capacity of Mo2S3 up to 960 K. A critical evaluation of the thermodynamic properties, phase equilibria, and phase diagram information in the literature was carried out to facilitate the thermodynamic optimization of the Mo-S system. The obtained thermodynamic description of the Mo-S system can satisfactorily represent most of the reliable thermodynamic and phase diagram information. Pressure-temperature (P-T), pressure-composition (P-x), and temperature-composition (T-x) diagrams of the Mo-S system were utilized to study the thermal decomposition of MoS2 for raw Mo production. Reduced pressure and high temperature are thermodynamically favorable conditions for the MoS2 reduction process.</p>

      <p>Gas tungsten arc deposits were made on substrate of stainless steel 304 using IN625 wires modified with 0.4 wt% B in shielding argon. The temperature profiles were simulated by the modified Rosenthal 3D equation. The re-melting boundary correlated well with the hardness profile and corresponding microstructure evolution along the as-manufactured sample. The upper section had higher hardness than the lower section. This high hardness was attributed to the existence of continuous eutectics (Laves phase and NbC) in the inter-dendritic regions. These eutectics in the lower section partially re-melted in this multi-pass process to form non-continuous features contributing to a lower hardness. Moreover, fine isolated borides precipitated out from the γ matrix in lower section as a result of the multiple thermal cycles. The eutectic phases were identified to be Laves phase with few NbC. The isolated borides were confirmed as M5B3 type of boride by TEM. Modeling of the segregation behavior of the major alloying elements according to Clyne-Kurz equations was conducted and the results were in good agreement with chemical concentration profiles.</p>

      <p>The structural phase transition in MoS2 promises applications in novel nanoelectronic devices. Elastic strain engineering can not only serve as a potential route for phase transition engineering, but also reveal potential ferroelastic behavior of MoS2 nanostructures. However, the elastic strain required for phase transition in monolayer MoS2 is far beyond its elastic limit, thus inhibiting the experimental realization. In this study, employing density functional theory calculations, we uncover that by forming heterostructure with buckled 2D materials, such as silicene, germanene and stanene, the critical phase transition strain required in monolayer MoS2 can be drastically reduced. Particularly when MoS2 forms sandwiched structures with silicene or stanene, the uniaxial and biaxial critical strain can be reduced to ∼0.06 and ∼0.03, respectively, which is well below the experimental elastic limit. This theoretical study not only proposes an experimental achievable strategy for flexible phase transition design in MoS2 nanostructure, but also identifies those MoS2 heterostructures as 2D candidates for potential shape memory devices and pseudoelasticity applications.</p>

      <p>Phase transitions within two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) promise new possibilities for engineering their properties. Using first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we systematically examined the interfacial electronic coupling between the 2H phase monolayer with its polymorphic phases in several group IV TMD, i.e., MoS2 (MoSe2) and WS2 (WSe2), inherent bilayer heterostructures. It is found that the interface coupling, augmented by in-plane strain, can greatly modify the band structure of the 2H phase to induce bandgap transition (either indirect-to-direct or direct-to-indirect). Moreover, the effects of strain on the band structure can be well understood and predicted within the framework of deformation potential theory. The present study provides important insights toward engineering optoelectronic properties of TMD-based devices.</p>

Our findings show that RE2Zr2O7 pyrochlores exhibit low-lying optical phonon frequencies that correspond to RE-cation rattling vibrational modes. These frequencies become imaginary upon volume expansion, preventing correct determination of the free energy versus volume relation and thereby quantification of thermal expansion using QH phonon calculations. To address this challenge, we proposed a QH approximation approach based on stable phonon modes where the RE-cation rattling modes were systematically eliminated. This approach is shown to provide accurate predictions of the coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs) of RE2Zr2O7 pyrochlores, in good agreement with experimental measurements and data from first-principles molecular dynamics simulations. In addition, we showed that the QH Debye model considerably overestimates the magnitudes and wrongly predicts the trend for the CTEs of RE2Zr2O7 pyrochlores</p>

      <p>The effects of hydrogen charging on the mechanical response of FCC Ni and Pd under nanoindentation are systematically investigated by molecular dynamics simulations. Simulations consider a random H distribution and time scales prevent any diffusion of H during the simulations. Hydrogen charging is then found to reduce the threshold load for dislocation nucleation, i.e., the pop-in load, but only to a limited extent. After pop-in, the indentation response is largely independent of the presence of H. Furthermore, the influence of hydrogen charging on the pop-in load originates only from the hydrogen-induced swelling of the lattice. That is, H does not directly influence dislocation nucleation, either in terms of facilitating initial slip or interacting with the nascent dislocation(s). These findings suggest that rate-dependent processes, either associated with fluctuating nucleation or H transport, are necessary to interpret experimental observations of hydrogen-influenced</p>

      <p>The electronic and thermoelectric properties of a new carbon bulk material, three-dimensional (3D) graphene, are investigated in this study. Our results show that 3D graphene has unique electronic structure, i.e., near the Fermi level there exist Dirac cones. More importantly, the thermoelectric performance of 3D graphene is excellent, at room temperature the thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) is 0.21, an order of magnitude higher than that of graphene. By introducing line defects, the ZT of 3D graphene could be enhanced to 1.52, indicating 3D graphene is a powerful candidate for constructing novel thermoelectric materials.</p>

      <p>Planar graphene/h-BN (GPBN) heterostructures promise low-dimensional magnetic semiconductor materials of tunable bandgap. In the present study, interplay between 3d transition metal (TM) atoms and single vacancies (SVs) at the armchair interface in a planar GPBN monolayer was investigated through first principle density functional theory calculations. The TM-SV complexes were found to give rise to a rich set of magnetic states, originated from the interactions between valence electrons of the TM atom with dangling orbitals at the SV. The magnetic state at a TM-SV complex was further shown to be tunable upon the application of strain and electric field. The present study suggests a route to enrich and engineer the magnetic states of planar GPBN heterostructures, providing new insights for the design of tunable low-dimensional spintronic devices.</p>

      <p>The polymorphism of two dimensional MoS2 promises new possibilities for nanoelectronics. The realization of those possibilities necessitates techniques to enable flexible and controllable phase engineering of MoS2. In the present study, based on first-principles calculations, a new and flexible route to engineer the phase stability of MoS2 by interfacing it with a GaN or AlN substrate is reported. Depending on the surface termination of the underlying substrate, MoS2 may exhibit either the 2H or 1T′ (1T′′) phase. The interface coupling between MoS2 and the substrate also affects the phase transition kinetics. In addition, electron doping can act as another means to influence MoS2–substrate interactions and enable further phase engineering of MoS2. The present findings contribute to new knowledge towards phase engineering of MoS2 and the design of hybrid nanodevices comprising both 2D and 3D optoelectronic materials.</p>

      <p>Using density functional theory and the non-equilibrium Green’s function method, we investigate the spin-dependent transport and optoelectronic properties of the graphyne-based molecular magnetic tunnel junctions (MMTJs). We find that these MMTJs exhibit an outstanding tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect. The TMR value is as high as 106%. When the magnetization directions of two electrodes are antiparallel under positive or negative bias voltages, two kinds of pure spin currents can be obtained in the systems. Furthermore, under the irradiation of infrared, visible or ultraviolet light, spin-polarized photocurrents can be generated in the MMTJs, but the corresponding microscopic mechanisms are different. More importantly, if the magnetization directions of two electrodes are antiparallel, the photocurrents with different spins are spatially separated, appearing at different electrodes. This phenomenon provides a new way to simultaneously generate two spin currents.</p>

      <p>Employing density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, the generalized-stacking-fault energy (GSFE) curves along two crystallographic slips, glide and shuffle, for both pristine graphene and impurity of boron (B) or nitrogen (N) doped graphene were examined. The effects of B and N doping on the GSFE were clarified and correlated with local electron interactions and bonding configurations. The GSFE data were then used to analyze dislocation dipole and core structure and subsequently combined with the Peierls–Nabarro (P–N) model to examine the role of doping on several key characteristics of dislocations in graphene. We showed that the GSFE curve may be significantly altered by the presence of dopants, which subsequently leads to profound modulations of dislocation properties, such as increasing spontaneous pair-annihilation distance and reducing resistance to dislocation slip. Our results indicate that doping can play an important role in controlling dislocation density and microscopic plasticity in graphene, thereby providing critical insights for dopant-mediated defect engineering in graphene.</p>

      <p>Rare-earth pyrochlores, commonly exhibiting remarkably low lattice thermal conductivities, are considered as promising topcoat materials for thermal barrier coatings. However the structural origin underlying their low thermal conductivities remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the phonon properties of two groups of RE pyrochlores, Ln2Zr2O7 (Ln = La, Nd, Sm, Gd) and Gd2T2O7 (T = Zr, Hf, Sn, Pb) employing density functional theory and quasi harmonic approximation. Through the relaxation time approximation (RTA) with Debye model, the thermal conductivities of those RE pyrochlores were predicted, showing good agreement with experimental measurements. The low thermal conductivities of RE pyrochlores were shown to largely come from the interference between the low-lying optical branches and acoustic branches. The structural origin underlying the low-lying optical branches was then clarified and the competition between scattering processes in transverse and longitude acoustic branches was discussed.</p>

      <p>Three dimensional hierarchical structures constructed with low dimensional nanoscale building blocks have become a new research focus for lithium storage. Some hierarchical structured compounds, such as V2O5, Co3O4 and MoS2 micro/nanoflowers, have been synthesized for energy storage applications. However, it still remains a challenge to fabricate well-designed hierarchical MoO2 microflowers. This paper reports on a morphology-controlled synthesis of hierarchical peony-like MoO2 microspheres as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries. This hierarchical structure is fabricated via a simple template-free solvothermal method. The as-derived hierarchical MoO2 microspheres exhibit high specific capacity, high capacity retention, and remarkable cycling stability, when evaluated as an anode material for LIBs.</p>

      <p>We have investigated the phase transformation of bulk MoS2 crystals from the metastable metallic 1T/1T′ phase to the thermodynamically stable semiconducting 2H phase. The metastable 1T/1T′ material was prepared by Li intercalation and deintercalation. The thermally driven kinetics of the phase transformation were studied with in situ Raman and optical reflection spectroscopies and yield an activation energy of 400 ± 60 meV (38 ± 6 kJ/mol). We calculate the expected minimum energy pathways for these transformations using DFT methods. The experimental activation energy corresponds approximately to the theoretical barrier for a single formula unit, suggesting that nucleation of the phase transformation is quite local. We also report that femtosecond laser writing converts 1T/1T′ to 2H in a single laser pass. The mechanisms for the phase transformation are discussed.</p>

      <p>First-principles calculations were performed to investigate the phase stability and transition within
four monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) systems, i.e., MX2 (M ¼ Mo or W and X ¼ S
or Se) under coupled electron doping and lattice deformation. With the lattice distortion and electron
doping density treated as state variables, the energy surfaces of different phases were computed, and
the diagrams of energetically preferred phases were constructed. These diagrams assess the competition between different phases and predict conditions of phase transitions for the TMDs considered.
The interplay between lattice deformation and electron doping was identified as originating from the
deformation induced band shifting and band bending. Based on our findings, a potential design strategy combining an efficient electrolytic gating and a lattice straining to achieve controllable phase engineering in TMD monolayers was demonstrated.</p>

      <p>Graphene and boron nitride (GPBN) heterostructures provide a viable way to realize tunable bandgap, promising new opportunities in graphene-based nanoelectronic and optoelectronic devices. In the present study, we investigated the interplay between vacancies and graphene/h-BN interfaces in monolayer GPBN heterostructures. The energetics and kinetics of monovacancies and divacancies in monolayer GPBN heterostructures were examined using first-principle calculations. The interfaces were shown to be preferential locations for vacancy segregation. Meanwhile the kinetics of vacancies was found to be noticeably modified at interfaces, evidenced by the minimum energy paths and associated migration barriers calculations. The role of interfacial bonding configurations, energy states and polarization on the formation and diffusion of vacancies were discussed. Additionally we demonstrated that it is important to recognize the dissimilarities in the diffusion prefactor for different vacancies for accurate determination of the vacancy diffusion coefficient. Our results provide essential data for the modeling of vacancies in GPBN heterostructures, and important insights towards the precise engineering of defects, interfaces and quantum domains in the design of GPBN-based devices.</p>

      <p>In the present study, we investigate the irradiation-defects hybridized graphene scaffold as one potential building material for the anode of Li-ion batteries. Designating the Wigner V22 defect as a representative, we illustrate the interplay of Li atoms with the irradiation defects in graphene scaffolds. We examine the adsorption energetics and diffusion kinetics of Li in the vicinity of a Wigner V22 defect using density functional theory calculations. The equilibrium Li adsorption sites at the defect are identified and shown to be energetically preferable to the adsorption sites on pristine (bilayer) graphene. Meanwhile, the minimum energy paths and corresponding energy barriers for Li migration at the defect are determined and computed. We find that, while the defect is shown to exhibit certain trapping effects on Li motions on the graphene surface, it appears to facilitate the interlayer Li diffusion and enhance the charge capacity within its vicinity, because of the reduced interlayer spacing and characteristic symmetry associated with the defect. Our results provide critical assessment for the application of irradiated graphene scaffolds in Li-ion batteries.</p>

      <p>The cohesive energy (CE) of CoPt nanoparticles (NPs) with different sizes and shapes have been calculated by embedded-atom-method (EAM) potential. It is shown that CE of NPs with order or disorder structures decreases with the decrease of particle size, while the shape effects become obvious only at small size. The CE difference per atom between order and disorder structures decreases with the decrease of particle size, indicating that the possibility of order-disorder transition in small size becomes larger compared with these in large size. Significantly, the CE difference varies in proportion to order-disorder transition temperature (Tc ), which suggests that one can predict order-disorder transition of NPs by calculation the cohesive energy. The present calculated Tc of CoPt NPs is consistent with recent experiments, simulation and theoretical predictions, and the method can also be applied to study the order-disorder transition of FePt, FePd, and so on.</p>

      <p>Monte Carlo simulation of the order–disorder transition revealed that the transition temperature of Co–Pt nanowires increases with wire diameter, approaching the bulk value if the size is large enough. The transition temperature is affected by the shape of cross-section, though the shape effect is less significant than the size effect. It is showed that the rise of transition temperature in nanowires is largely due to the decrease of surface area compared with nanoparticles. The phase separation and tetragonalization are discussed by introducing mixing parameter and asphericity parameter. It is also found that the order–disorder transition starts from the surface and then to the core, indicating that the order–disorder transition of nanowires is a surface-dominant phenomenon, governed by the atomic under coordination.</p>
